# FPGA-Based AI Voice Assistant

## Description
This project is an embedded AI voice assistant built using FPGA technology, designed for real-time voice command processing and natural language understanding. It combines low-power, high-efficiency hardware acceleration with NLP capabilities to create a functional assistant that can operate in edge environments without relying on cloud services.

The assistant aims to support core voice-based tasks such as:
- Recognizing and interpreting spoken commands
- Performing local inference to trigger actions
- Offering a platform for experimenting with offline AI on hardware

## Features
- ⚡ Real-time voice command processing
- 🧠 Onboard natural language understanding (NLP)
- 🔌 Fully offline, no internet required
- 🎙️ Microphone and speaker integration
- 🧱 Designed to run on FPGA with optional soft-core processor
- 📦 Modular design for easy expansion and customization

## Hardware and Software Requirements

### Hardware
- ✅ FPGA Development Board (e.g., Xilinx Artix-7, Intel DE10-Nano)
- ✅ Microphone (I2S, analog, or USB)
- ✅ Speaker or audio output module
- ✅ Optional: Raspberry Pi or MCU for hybrid control

### Software
- Xilinx Vivado or Intel Quartus (for synthesis)
- Python 3.8+ (for preprocessing, training models, etc.)
- TensorFlow Lite / ONNX (for lightweight model deployment)
- Verilog or VHDL (FPGA modules)
- Optional: C/C++ for soft processor integration
